### Conversion Funnels

1. **Free → Starter**: Limit hit (6 users) + Feature needs
2. **Starter → Professional**: Limit hit (21 users) + Advanced features
3. **Professional → Enterprise**: Limit hit (51 users) + Enterprise needs
4. **Any → Lifetime**: Early adopters, long-term commitment

### Implementation Recommendations

1. **Start with Monthly Plans**: Test pricing acceptance
2. **Add Annual After 3 months**: Once you have data on monthly conversions
3. **Lifetime Launch**: Limited-time offer (first 6 months, first 500 customers)
4. **Grandfathering**: Existing users keep their pricing if you increase later
5. **Usage Warnings**: Alert at 80% of user limit, strong CTA at 95%
6. **Trial Period**: Consider 14-day free trial for Starter+ (no credit card required)

### Competitive Advantages to Highlight

- **Lifetime Option**: Unique in the market

### Alternative Pricing Models to Consider

**Per-User Pricing** (Alternative):
- Free: Up to 5 users
- €2.50/user/month (min €15/month for 6+ users)
- €2.00/user/month yearly (min €120/year for 6+ users)
- Lifetime: €50/user one-time (max 200 users)

**Hybrid Model** (Alternative):
- Base fee + per-user fee
- Starter: €10/month + €2/user
- Professional: €30/month + €1.50/user
- Enterprise: €100/month + €1/user

### Final Recommendation

**Go with the tiered pricing model** (not per-user) because:
1. Predictable pricing for customers
2. Easier to communicate value
3. Better conversion from Free → Paid (clear upgrade path)
4. Lifetime plan is more attractive with flat pricing
5. Less friction during team growth

### Post-Launch Pricing Optimization

- **A/B test** pricing after 500 customers
- Monitor:
  - Conversion rates between tiers
  - Churn rate by tier
  - Average revenue per customer
  - Feature usage by tier
- Consider adding mid-tier if gap between Starter → Professional is too large
- Potentially add "Teams" tier (100 users) between Professional and Enterprise

### Lifetime Plan Strategy

**Why offer Lifetime?**
- Immediate cash flow for early-stage startup
- Creates customer loyalty and advocates
- Reduces churn (they've paid upfront)
- Word-of-mouth marketing from happy lifetime customers

**Risks to Manage:**
- Don't oversell (limit to 5-10% of total customer base)
- Ensure infrastructure costs are covered
- Set clear expectations on "lifetime" definition
- Consider tiered lifetime (Starter Lifetime, Pro Lifetime, Enterprise Lifetime)

### Tax Considerations

All prices are in EUR and should be displayed:
- **Excluding VAT** for B2B customers (reverse charge)
- **Including VAT** for B2C customers (varies by EU country, ~20%)
- Use Stripe Tax or similar to handle automatically
